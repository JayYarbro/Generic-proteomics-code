#Protein Analysis and Gene Annotation Repository

Introduction

This repository contains three scripts for protein analysis and gene annotation. These scripts are written in R and Python and perform various tasks, including data manipulation, statistical analysis, and gene annotation.

Script 1: Protein Analysis in R

Purpose: This R script is designed for protein data analysis, focusing on statistical testing and visualization.
Key Steps:
Data loading from an Excel file
Grouping and combining data for statistical comparison
Statistical tests with multiple comparisons adjustment
Generation of volcano plots for visualizing differentially expressed proteins
Usage: Ensure you have the required R packages installed and set the working directory to the input folder before executing the script.
Script 2: Correlation Analysis in R

Purpose: This R script analyzes the correlation between proteins in a dataset and generates a heatmap for visualization.
Key Steps:
Reading proteomics data from an Excel file
Computing the correlation matrix
Identifying top correlated variables
Creating a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix
Usage: Set the working directory to the location of your data and modify the filename as needed before running the script.
Script 3: Gene Annotation in Python

Purpose: This Python script annotates genes with their respective KEGG IDs.
Key Steps:
Installation of necessary Python libraries
Conversion of gene names to KEGG IDs using the BioServices library
Saving the annotated data as a TSV file
Usage: Install the required libraries using pip and execute the script to annotate genes and generate a TSV file with KEGG IDs.
